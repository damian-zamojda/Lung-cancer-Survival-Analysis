# Lung cancer Survival Analysis Models comparison

Our research aims at patients’ lung cancer survival analysis from North Central Cancer Treatment Group. 
In the analysis we did a detailed research on the variables that determine whether patients get over a disease or surrender in a certain duration time. 
Thus we used a non-parametric statistic estimator to create a Kaplan-Meier Survival model to measure the survival function from lifetime duration data. 
We conducted the comparison of both ECOG and Karnofsky Performance Score indicators and designed the formula of lung cancer survival where time is a dependent variable. 
The parametric models we used have varied distributions and are as follows: Weibull Model, Gompertz Model, Lognormal Model and Extreme Values.

## Summary

For the purpose of this research we can sum up, that the age of a patient, 
calories daily consumed at meals and weight loss are not relevant in terms of lung cancer survival analysis.

What actually matters, is the gender of patients suffering from lung cancer. 
Males survival after the diagnosis and treatment is lower than among females in time duration.

The most impact on that outcome has an ECOG performance score of 2 and 3, 
which indicates a patient’s performance status on general well-being with cancer on the level of symptomatic, 
but spending around 50% in bed during the day. Patients assessed by higher scores survive less number of days after the treatment.

As for the Karnofsky performance score rated by physicians, positively interpreted scores, so 80, 90 and 100 are significant. 
It means that patients who are in a perfect state or suffering from little inability in the job environment, 
survive a greater number of days after the lung cancer treatment.
